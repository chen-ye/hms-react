# HMS (0.0.0) Preview
Hi!  This is HMS, what will hopefully become a full-featured hackathon management webapp that allows organizers to focus on the unique parts of their hackathon.  

## Installation
1. You'll need meteor, which you can install at [meteor.com](https://www.meteor.com/).

2. Then, clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/chen-ye/hms-react.git`.  Alternately, you can [download](https://github.com/chen-ye/hms-react/archive/master.zip) a static version of this repo. 

3. Then, using the console, `cd` into `hms-react/hms`, and type `meteor install`.

4. You're set up!  Now, you can type `meteor` and it'll take care of installing the remaining dependencies and actually building and running the app.  Using a default install, you should be able to view your install using a browser at http://locahost:300.

## Configuration
Hold on though, you probably want to actually *use* this thing, don't you?

In order to do so, you'll need to set up an admin account in `hms-react/hms/private/config` first.  The syntax should be right in the file.  

## Contribute!  
HMS is still in very very early development, and any help is appreciated!  

Code, bugfixes, and pull requests are welcome, but I'd also love to hear organizer perspectives--what would *you* find useful to have?  [Let's chat!](https://github.com/chen-ye/hms-react/issues)
